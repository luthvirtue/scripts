Hello, my name is Farhan Luthfi.
I am an OCG Player in Medan, Indonesia.
I have played a weekly tournament at my local since 2011.
We don't have any official tournament here in Indonesia.
That's why Master Duel really piqued my interest.
Here on Youtube, I upload a Master Duel video at least once a day.
You can subscribe to my channel if you want another daily dose of Master Duel videos especially about "Normal Summon Aleister".
